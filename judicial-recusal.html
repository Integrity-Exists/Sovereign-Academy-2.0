<h1>Motion to Recuse a Judge</h1>
<p>Every person has the right to a fair and impartial judge. If your judge is biased, has a conflict of interest, or has acted improperly ‚Äî you can file a motion to recuse (remove) them from your case.</p>
<h2>üö© Valid Grounds for Recusal</h2>
<ul>
<li>The judge has a personal relationship with one of the parties</li>
<li>The judge made comments outside court suggesting bias</li>
<li>The judge was involved in a previous case with you or your child</li>
<li>The judge is acting in a way that clearly shows favoritism or retaliation</li>
</ul>
<h2>üìù How to File</h2>
<ol>
<li>File a Motion to Recuse with a supporting affidavit</li>
<li>List the specific reason(s) you believe the judge cannot be fair</li>
<li>Include evidence: transcripts, witness declarations, or documented bias</li>
<li>Submit it before your next hearing (as early as possible)</li>
<li>Request a hearing on the motion if one is not automatically set</li>
