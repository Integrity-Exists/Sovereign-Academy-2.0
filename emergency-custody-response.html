<h1>Emergency Custody Response</h1>
<p>If your child was removed without a court order or legal notice, or DSS/CPS took them under questionable ‚Äúemergency‚Äù conditions ‚Äî this is how you respond. You have rights. You have options. Time is critical, but so is doing this right.</p>
<h2>üö® What to Do Immediately</h2>
<ol>
<li>Request a copy of the removal order in writing ‚Äî ask ‚ÄúWas there a court order for this removal?‚Äù</li>
<li>File a written objection (called an Objection to Removal or Motion to Challenge Emergency Removal)</li>
<li>Request an emergency hearing within 72 hours (in most states) and ask for a copy of the affidavit that justified the removal</li>
<li>Request discovery immediately ‚Äî including who made the report, police body cam, or CPS notes</li>
<li>Document everything: who took the child, when, where, what they said, who witnessed it</li>
</ol>
