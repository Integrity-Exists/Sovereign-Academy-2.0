    <h1>Courtroom Scripts for Warriors</h1>

    <p>Walking into court without a lawyer doesn’t mean walking in alone. These scripts give you the words — and the **confidence** — to stand tall, speak clearly, and make your record count. Use them as-is or ask Sage to tailor one to your case.</p>

    <h2>🎤 Opening Statement</h2>
    <pre>
“Your Honor, my name is [Your Name], and I am appearing today as a self-represented litigant. I’m here to ensure that the rights of myself and my child are protected, and to address the issues outlined in this case. I appreciate the opportunity to be heard.”
    </pre>

    <h2>🚫 Objecting in Court</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>“Objection, Your Honor — relevance.”</li>
      <li>“Objection — asked and answered.”</li>
      <li>“Objection — hearsay.”</li>
      <li>“Objection — assumes facts not in evidence.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📣 Requesting Continuance</h2>
    <pre>
“Your Honor, I respectfully request a continuance due to [reason: medical, missing records, newly retained evidence, etc.]. I need additional time to properly prepare and ensure a fair hearing.”
    </pre>

    <h2>📁 Filing a Motion</h2>
    <pre>
“Your Honor, I’d like to submit a written motion to [dismiss/remove/suppress/etc.], and I’m prepared to explain the basis for this request if the court is willing to hear it.”
    </pre>

    <h2>🧠 Cross-Examining Witness</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>“Isn’t it true that…?”</li>
      <li>“Were you present when…?”</li>
      <li>“Can you provide any documentation to support that statement?”</li>
      <li>“Have you ever made a report like this before?”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💬 Final Statement</h2>
    <pre>
“Your Honor, I’ve provided the court with facts, evidence, and lawful arguments. I ask only that this case be judged fairly, based on truth and justice — not bias or assumption.”
    </pre>
