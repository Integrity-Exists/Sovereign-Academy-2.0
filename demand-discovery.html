    <h1>Demand Discovery & File a Motion to Compel</h1>

    <p>If the other side — especially DSS or CPS — refuses to hand over evidence, you don’t beg. You file a <strong>Demand for Discovery</strong> and, if they ignore it, you follow up with a <strong>Motion to Compel</strong>. No more games.</p>

    <h2>📦 What You Can Demand</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Caseworker notes and internal memos</li>
      <li>Photos, videos, recordings</li>
      <li>Police reports and interview summaries</li>
      <li>Names of witnesses or accusers</li>
      <li>ICPC documents or foster care contracts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📝 How to Demand It</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Write a Demand for Discovery letter with your name, case number, and list of what you need</li>
      <li>Send it via certified mail or file it with the Clerk and serve the agency</li>
      <li>Wait 10–14 days for a response</li>
      <li>If they ignore it — file a Motion to Compel with proof of your request</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>🔥 Motion to Compel</h2>
    <p>The Motion to Compel tells the court the other party is stonewalling — and asks the judge to issue an order forcing them to turn it over. You can also ask for sanctions (punishment) if they refuse again.</p>
