    <h1>Sue CPS in Federal Court</h1>

    <p>If Child Protective Services (CPS) has violated your constitutional rights — you CAN sue them in federal court. The most common way is by filing a civil rights lawsuit under <strong>42 U.S. Code § 1983</strong>.</p>

    <h2>⚖️ What Is a 1983 Lawsuit?</h2>
    <p>42 U.S.C. § 1983 allows you to sue state or local government workers (like DSS or CPS agents) who violate your federally protected rights — like the right to due process, family integrity, or to be free from unlawful searches and seizures.</p>

    <h2>🧾 Common CPS Violations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Removing your child without a court order or emergency</li>
      <li>Entering your home without a warrant or consent</li>
      <li>Coercing statements or threatening loss of custody without cause</li>
      <li>Ignoring evidence or denying hearings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📋 What You’ll Need to File</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>A written complaint (civil cover sheet + statement of facts)</li>
      <li>The name(s) of the CPS agents involved</li>
      <li>Specific dates and rights violated</li>
      <li>A request for relief (money damages, injunctive relief, etc.)</li>
      <li>Filing fee ($400+ or file to waive with form IFP)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>🚨 Time Limits</h2>
    <p>These lawsuits are subject to a statute of limitations — often 2 years from the date of the violation. Don’t wait too long.</p>
