    <h1>How to Read a Court Docket or Case File</h1>

    <p>Your court docket is the official record of everything that happens in your case. It looks confusing at first, but once you know the basics, it becomes a powerful tool to track what’s happening and what’s coming next.</p>

    <h2>🧾 What You'll Usually See</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Case Number:</strong> ID code for your case</li>
      <li><strong>Style of Case:</strong> “State v. Smith” or “Lopez v. DSS”</li>
      <li><strong>Judge Assigned:</strong> The presiding judge</li>
      <li><strong>Parties:</strong> Who’s suing who, or who’s being charged</li>
      <li><strong>Charge Code / Cause:</strong> What law was broken or issue is being heard</li>
      <li><strong>Events:</strong> Hearings, motions, filings — with dates</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📅 Common Abbreviations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>FTA</strong> – Failure to Appear</li>
      <li><strong>Nolle Pros</strong> – Prosecutor dropped the charge</li>
      <li><strong>MTD</strong> – Motion to Dismiss</li>
      <li><strong>PTC</strong> – Pretrial Conference</li>
      <li><strong>RCS</strong> – Request for Continuance Scheduled</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📂 Case File Extras</h2>
    <p>In your full file, you may also find: affidavits, police reports, transcripts, exhibits, GAL reports, orders, and correspondence. Ask to view or copy your case file at the Clerk’s office — they may charge per page.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Ask Sage</h2>
    <p>Upload or copy your docket and Ask Sage to help you decode it line by line.</p>
