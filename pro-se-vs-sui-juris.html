    <h1>Pro Se vs. Sui Juris: What’s the Difference?</h1>

    <p>If you're representing yourself in court, you may see two terms: <strong>Pro Se</strong> and <strong>Sui Juris</strong>. They are NOT the same — and how you present yourself can affect how you're treated in court.</p>

    <h2>⚖️ Pro Se</h2>
    <p>Latin for "on one’s own behalf." Courts recognize this as a standard legal status for someone acting without an attorney. But you're still considered a “legal person” under the court's corporate jurisdiction.</p>

    <h2>👁️‍🗨️ Sui Juris</h2>
    <p>Latin for "of one’s own right." This implies you're appearing as a natural man or woman under common law, not under the full jurisdiction of the court’s corporate/legal fiction. It signals sovereignty — and often resistance to standard assumptions.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Which One Should I Use?</h2>
    <p>If you're aiming to exercise rights beyond normal procedure (like challenging jurisdiction, or asserting constitutional status), you may prefer to appear <strong>Sui Juris</strong>. But be ready — some judges don’t like it, and you'll need to speak with precision and strength.</p>
