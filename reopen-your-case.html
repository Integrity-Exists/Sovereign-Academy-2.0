    <h1>Reopen Your Case</h1>

    <p>Just because a judge signed it doesn’t mean it’s over. If your case ended unfairly — if your attorney dropped the ball, if new evidence came to light, or if fraud was involved — you may be able to reopen it and fight again.</p>

    <h2>⚖️ Legal Tools to Reopen a Case</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Judgment:</strong> Used when there was fraud, lack of notice, or serious error</li>
      <li><strong>Motion for New Trial:</strong> If your lawyer failed or new info would have changed the result</li>
      <li><strong>Appeal:</strong> If filed in time, you can challenge the outcome to a higher court</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📝 What to Say in Your Motion</h2>
    <p>Include your name, case number, and exactly what was wrong — for example:</p>
    <pre>
“My attorney failed to present critical evidence. I only discovered after judgment that [evidence or violation]. I request this case be reopened in the interest of justice.”
    </pre>
