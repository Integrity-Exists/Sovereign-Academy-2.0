    <h1>Defend Against False CPS Allegations</h1>

    <p>You’re not alone. False CPS claims are more common than people think — and more terrifying than most can imagine. But truth and strategy are stronger than fear. Here's how to fight false allegations and win back your life.</p>

    <h2>🚨 Step-by-Step Defense</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Demand Discovery:</strong> Get every piece of evidence DSS/CPS has (or claims to have)</li>
      <li><strong>Get the Reporter ID:</strong> Request the identity or affidavit of the person who made the claim</li>
      <li><strong>Challenge the Basis:</strong> File a motion if the removal or action was based on hearsay, opinion, or no actual harm</li>
      <li><strong>Collect Counter-Evidence:</strong> Witness statements, clean drug tests, school letters, text history, photos</li>
      <li><strong>Demand an Emergency Hearing:</strong> If your child was removed without cause or proof</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>💥 Sample Statement</h2>
    <pre>
“Your Honor, I am the victim of a false allegation. There is no evidence of abuse or neglect, and I have provided documentation to show my innocence. I respectfully request that the court dismiss these actions immediately.”
    </pre>
