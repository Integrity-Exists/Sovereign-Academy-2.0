    <h1>How to Serve Motions and Legal Documents</h1>

    <p>Serving your motions properly is just as important as filing them. If the other side doesn’t get the paperwork — or you can’t prove they did — the court might ignore it. Here’s how to do it right, and on time.</p>

    <h2>📦 What Does “Service” Mean?</h2>
    <p>“Service” means legally delivering a copy of your motion or document to all other parties involved in the case — usually the other side (or their attorney), and sometimes DSS or the GAL.</p>

    <h2>📋 How to Serve Documents</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Make a copy of the signed motion or notice</li>
      <li>Deliver by one of the legal methods:
        <ul>
          <li>📫 Certified Mail (with return receipt)</li>
          <li>📧 Email (if the court or party agreed in writing)</li>
          <li>📦 Personal delivery by a non-party adult</li>
          <li>🧾 Sheriff or Process Server (if needed)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Fill out a “Proof of Service” form and file it with the Clerk</li>
      <li>Keep your tracking numbers, signatures, or receipts as evidence</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>📄 Coming Soon</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Proof of Service Form (fillable PDF)</li>
      <li>Service Affidavit Template</li>
      <li>Motion Checklist (before you file)</li>
    </ul>
