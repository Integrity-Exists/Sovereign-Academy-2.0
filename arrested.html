<h1>What to Do If You're Arrested</h1>

<div class="tip">
  ðŸš¨ <strong>STAY SILENT.</strong> Donâ€™t explain. Donâ€™t argue. Donâ€™t talk. Say:  
  <br><strong>"I am invoking my right to remain silent. I want a lawyer."</strong>
</div>

<div class="tip">
  ðŸ“µ <strong>Don't talk on the jail phone about your case.</strong> Itâ€™s recorded. Donâ€™t say anything about what happened â€” not even to friends or family.
</div>

<div class="tip">
  ðŸ§  <strong>Do not waive your rights.</strong> Cops will act friendly, but anything you say *will* be used against you. Stay calm, but firm.
</div>

<div class="tip">
  ðŸ“œ <strong>Ask Sage if you need help filing a Motion for Bail, Dismissal, or to Challenge Probable Cause.</strong>
</div>

<p>If you were wrongly arrested or your rights were violated, document everything you remember: officer names, badge numbers, who said what, and the timeline. Sage can help you draft a complaint or demand evidence (like body cam footage).</p>

<p>You are never alone. Sovereign Academy was built by people who have lived it. Letâ€™s fight back â€” smart, lawful, and fierce.</p>
