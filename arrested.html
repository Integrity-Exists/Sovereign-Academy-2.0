    <h1>🚨 What to Do If You're Arrested</h1>

    <p>Being arrested is terrifying. Even when you know your rights, it’s hard to think straight. That confusion? It’s by design.</p>

    <p>This page is built to anchor you in the chaos. If you’re scared, overwhelmed, or just want to be ready — this is for you.</p>

    <h2>🛑 First Rule: SHUT UP</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Say: <strong>"I invoke my right to remain silent."</strong></li>
      <li>Then say: <strong>"I want an attorney present before any questioning."</strong></li>
      <li>Then: <strong>Say NOTHING ELSE.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Talking your way out will not work. Cops are trained to get you talking. Anything you say WILL be used — twisted, clipped, taken out of context.</p>

    <h2>🤐 What NOT to Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>❌ Don’t argue, resist, or try to explain</li>
      <li>❌ Don’t consent to searches ("I do not consent to a search")</li>
      <li>❌ Don’t lie — just stay silent</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📜 Miranda Warnings</h2>
    <p>Police are only required to read your rights **if they question you after arrest.** If they skip it, it doesn’t mean your arrest is invalid — but it can impact admissibility in court. Ask Sage for details if this happened to you.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Ground Yourself</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Breathe slow — fear makes you forget your training</li>
      <li>Look for cameras — they may protect you</li>
      <li>Memorize the officer’s badge number & name if possible</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💬 Sample Phrase to Memorize:</h2>
    <blockquote style="background: #f2f2f2; padding: 15px; border-left: 5px solid #2C3E50;">
      "Officer, I do not consent to any searches, and I am exercising my right to remain silent. I will not answer questions without my attorney present."
    </blockquote>

    <h2>📤 After the Arrest</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>📞 Call someone you trust ASAP — give location, charges, and name</li>
      <li>🧾 Request a copy of the arrest report as soon as released</li>
      <li>🧑‍⚖️ If assigned a public defender, ask for a copy of discovery and case notes</li>
      <li>📚 Ask Sage or use Sovereign Academy to start prepping your defense</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧠 Final Thought</h2>
    <p>You may be judged for knowing your rights. That’s okay. Stay calm. Stay firm. Never forget: **You are not powerless.** You are just up against a system that benefits when you panic.</p>
