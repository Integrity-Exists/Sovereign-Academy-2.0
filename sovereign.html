    <h1>🇺🇸 How to Become Sovereign</h1>
    <p>Let’s be clear: Being sovereign does **not** mean being anti-American. It means being **pro-responsibility**, **pro-accountability**, and **pro-freedom** — the kind our founding documents once promised.</p>

    <p>The truth is, the system today often feels like a rigged game. But we don’t fight that by yelling at the board. We fight it by **learning the rules**, **owning our power**, and **stepping outside of fear-based obedience.**</p>

    <h2>🧠 First: Sovereignty is a Mindset</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You govern your own choices.</li>
      <li>You educate yourself about rights and duties.</li>
      <li>You don’t wait for permission to exist — but you also don’t attack blindly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📜 Second: Know the Law vs. Legal Fiction</h2>
    <p>The U.S. legal system is built on a distinction between the **natural person** (you) and the **legal person** (your name in all caps). Some call this the "strawman." Understanding this concept is key to most sovereign philosophies — but be cautious of anyone who says it’s a “magic fix.”</p>

    <h2>⚠️ Beware of Sovereign Scams</h2>
    <p>There are people out there selling sovereignty like it’s a subscription service. Trust no one selling status or documents without teaching you the **why** behind the **what**. Ask questions. Do your research. Ask Sage.</p>

    <h2>🛠 How to Start Your Sovereign Path</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Study the Constitution, UCC, and Black’s Law Dictionary.</li>
      <li>Understand contracts: licenses, court orders, even your birth certificate.</li>
      <li>Learn about trusts, private status, and rescinding implied consent.</li>
      <li>Speak less. Learn more. File only when you know what you’re doing.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Remember: You don’t need to fight the government. You just need to stop letting it override your will through fear or ignorance. That’s sovereignty.</p>
