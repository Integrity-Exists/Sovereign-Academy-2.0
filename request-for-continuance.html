    <h1>Requesting a Court Continuance</h1>

    <p>Need more time before your court date? You can file a <strong>Request for Continuance</strong> (also called a Motion to Reschedule) to ask the judge to move the hearing to a later date. This is common and legal — especially for medical reasons, new evidence, or needing time to prepare.</p>

    <h2>📋 When You Can Ask</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You just received notice and need more prep time</li>
      <li>You have a schedule conflict (with proof)</li>
      <li>You’re waiting on documents or records</li>
      <li>You were recently hospitalized or have a disability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📝 How to Request It</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Write a short letter or motion titled “Request for Continuance”</li>
      <li>Include your name, case number, and scheduled court date</li>
      <li>State your reason and request a specific delay (example: 30 days)</li>
      <li>Attach any documents that support your reason (hospital paperwork, appointment slips, etc.)</li>
      <li>File with the Clerk and send a copy to the other party (if required)</li>
    </ol>

      <li>Script for calling the Clerk’s Office</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💡 Tips</h2>
    <p>Don’t wait until the last minute — try to file at least 3–5 business days before your hearing. Always get proof of submission.</p>
