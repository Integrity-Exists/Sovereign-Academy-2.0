<h1>File a Complaint Against a Judge or Attorney</h1>
<p>If you’ve been mistreated by a judge, Guardian ad Litem, or lawyer — especially one assigned to your case — you can file an official complaint. These go to a judicial review board (for judges) or the state bar (for lawyers).</p>
<h2>⚖️ When to File a Complaint</h2>
<ul>
<li>The judge violated your rights, denied due process, or showed bias</li>
<li>A GAL acted outside their role or in favor of one party</li>
<li>A lawyer ignored your instructions, withheld evidence, or worked against you</li>
</ul>
<h2>📝 How to Do It</h2>
<ol>
<li>Write a detailed statement with names, dates, and specific actions</li>
<li>Attach any evidence (transcripts, letters, emails, recordings)</li>
<li>Submit it to your state’s Judicial Review Board (for judges) or Bar Association (for lawyers)</li>
<li>Ask for a copy to be added to your court case record</li>
</ol>
<h2>🔍 Where to File</h2>
<p><strong>Judges:</strong> File with your state’s Judicial Inquiry Commission or Office of Court Ethics<br/>
<strong>Attorneys:</strong> File with your State Bar Disciplinary Board</p>
