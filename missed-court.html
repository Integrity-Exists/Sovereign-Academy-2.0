<h1>Missed Court? Donâ€™t Panic. Here's What to Do.</h1>
<p>If you missed your court date â€” take a breath. You're not alone, and there are ways to fix it before it spirals. This page will help you act fast to minimize damage and avoid jail time.</p>
<h2>ðŸš¨ Step-by-Step Action Plan</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Call the Clerkâ€™s Office ASAP</strong> â€“ Ask if a bench warrant has been issued. Write down who you spoke to and what they said.</li>
<li><strong>If there's a warrant</strong>, ask if you can turn yourself in and immediately request a new court date (called a "motion to quash warrant").</li>
<li><strong>File a Motion to Reschedule</strong> â€“ Explain why you missed it (illness, transportation, no notice, etc.). Attach proof if possible.</li>
<li><strong>Show up immediately</strong> if the court is open â€” sometimes you can handle it same-day at the docket call.</li>
<li><strong>Contact your bondsman</strong> or pretrial officer if you have one â€” failure to appear can also trigger bond forfeiture.</li>
</ol>
<h2>ðŸ’¡ Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Act within 24â€“72 hours of the missed date if you can</li>
<li>Keep records of everything you file or submit</li>
<li>If arrested, politely tell the judge you intended to appear and are prepared now</li>
</ul>
